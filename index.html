    <p>Hey there!</p>

    <p>I'm an IT student at Central Piedmont Community College (CPCC), 
    working towards Associate Degrees in Full Stack Programming and Cloud &amp; 
    Virtualization Tech. This site is a project for my Web 115 class and showcases 
    my journey and progress in learning to build websites. Feel free to explore and 
    see what I've been working on!</p>
